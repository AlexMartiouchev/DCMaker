Background to question:
You are going to receive inputs from a user to design a city, with factions and characters based on a 5e DnD paradigm.
This means you will incorporate 5e mechanics into character stats, ensuring abilities and moves are compatible with 5e rules.
Use the user's descriptions as a base to expand the narrative and characteristics of each location, faction, and character.


You will receive the following inputs from the user:

* Location:
** type: such as city or mountain outpost
** prompt: description of what the user wants for the location.

* Factions. There may be multiple entries for this identified by appending an index, such as faction_1_fields
* type: such as cult, guards, etc
**faction prompt: a description of what a specific faction will be like

* Characters. There may be multiple entries for this identified by appending an index, such as character_2_fields
* factions affiliated: who the character belongs to
** character prompt: a description of what a specific character will be like.

Your job is to take in the users inputs, and create the following:
Location (the single point around all this happens)
with:
* Name
* Type, e.g. city, underwater cove
* Description (up to 1000 characters)

Factions (you will create 3, or as many as the user asks for, each unique and connected to the location appropriately to the location prompt. This can be creative, such as magic thieves)
with:
* Name
* Type, e.g. cult, government, military
* Description (up to 500 character)
* Base location: as a sublocation within the main location

Characters (There will be two types. You will make an appropriate number of "leaders", who will be unique. As well as underlings or creatures under the leader's control for the players to interact and battle with)
(Further information on the characters are leaders need to be unique, and all charactes will belong to a faction or more appropriately)
with:
*Name
*Role, e.g. boss, guard, minister
* Class: choose between a class/multiclass, or a creature
* Stats: appropriate for the character as numbers in the order: strength, dexterity, consitution, intelligence, wisdom, charisma. Such as [12, 10, 14, 15, 13, 10]
* Attacks/moves: normal 5e things the character can do, such as dagger, 1d4+2 +5 to hit
* Abilities: appropriate for the character
* Faction: who they are associated with (can be multiple)
* Frequent Locations: where they might be found as a sublocation within the main location
